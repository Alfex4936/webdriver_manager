= python webdriver manager

The main ida is to simplify managemet of binary drivers for different browsers.

For now support:

- ChromeDriver
- GeckoDriver

Before:
You should download binary chromedriver, unzip it somwhere in you PC and set path to this driver like this:

```
webdriver.Chrome('/home/user/drivers/chromedriver')
```

It's boring!!! Moreover every time the new version of driver released, you should go and repeat all steps again and again.

With webdriver manager, you just need to do two simple steps:

Install manager:

```
pip install webdriver_manager
```

```
webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install().path)
```

It will automatically download latest release of chromedriver and set path. Moreover when the new version of the driver
will be released, webriver manager will download it and update path.

This will make your test automation more elegant and robust!
